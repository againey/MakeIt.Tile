# User's Manual

MakeIt.Tile originally used [Sandcastle](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB)
to format and build documentation in HTML format. The raw content for this
process is preserved in this repository until it can be updated or trasferred
to a different format, perhaps based on markdown.

For now, you can refer to the online
[Make It Tile User's Manual](https://experilous.com/1/product/make-it-tile/2.0/documentation/)
for v2.0 from November 2016.
